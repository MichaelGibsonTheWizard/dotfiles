OK, so what's is here?

assets/
js/
lib/

all these folders are part of uBlock's core. They are there because inside uBlock they sometimes use relative
reference to resources. So putting them there exactly resembles how uBlock is launched

When updating uBlock's, remember:
1) replace  `vAPI.getURL(url);` with `vAPI.getURL('html/' + url);` at `api.fetchText()` function in `assets.js`
2) match settings in `background.js`
3) point to proper icons in `vapi-background.js` in vAPI.setIcon(), or comment setting icon.
4) to check assets update go to `storage.js`, ÂµBlock.assetObserver

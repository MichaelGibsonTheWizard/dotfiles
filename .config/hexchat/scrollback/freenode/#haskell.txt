I've removed the old global ghc + cabal and I've done stack setup and re-installed a number of packages local to that ghc... but some of the old packages aren't installing via `stack install` (which I understood used cabal under the covers)
T 1535700241 18<zenspider18>	1) Some of the dependencies aren't resolving correctly, so I have to add them to the global stack.yaml in the extra-deps. That seems really odd, and/or broken?

T 1535738350 18<sent1nel_18>	fenedor: imagine a document with hundreds of thousands of changes. essentially you are maintaining a perfect record of hundreds of thousands of events, probably with snapshots. usually, you don't need that record; nobody ctrl+zs back to the first character of document, typically, from a publishable state.
T 1535738358 18<maerwald18>	because you are not saving state
T 1535738399 18<maerwald18>	event sourcing is horribly slow for startup though, unless you have a snapshotting system, which an be quite tricky
T 1535738410 18<fenedor18>	maerwald, you mean, if I have to prove for example that a user read a file at a specific time, event sourcing might make sense? Is event sourcing fitted for audit trails, or should that be handled by something else?
T 1535738434 18<fenedor18>	maerwald, i think, `eventful` or something like that has a snapshotting feature already
T 1535738440 18<maerwald18>	well, that... and that your core business logic can be totally pure!
T 1535738446 18<sent1nel_18>	snapshotting isn't that tricky, but it can be. another problem: without snapshots or a search index, good luck looking up an aggregate by any field by anything other than id, such as an e-mail address for user aggregates

Aug 30 22:56:34 <arahael>	I want to eventually write some tests where I want to demonstrate that randomAst -> Print -> Parse == original randomAst.  What do I read to find out how to do this? I assume that quickcheck is the tool for this?

Aug 30 22:59:01 <c_wraith>	quickcheck definitely works for that.
Aug 30 22:59:09 *	arahael reads wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck1 - it does indeed look like what I need.
Aug 30 22:59:13 <c_wraith>	You tell it how to build a random AST
Aug 30 22:59:18 <arahael>	c_wraith: Awesome, thanks for the confirmation.
Aug 30 22:59:22 <c_wraith>	then you give a function AST -> Bool
Aug 30 22:59:35 <c_wraith>	And it generates a bunch of ASTs to see if the property holds for all of them
Aug 30 22:59:38 <arahael>	c_wraith: Is it possible for it to generate the random AST for me? Given their types?

Aug 30 23:00:18 <c_wraith>	Well, you have to give it a description of how to randomize the type.  But then it takes care of creating all the instances that it tests with
Aug 30 23:00:47 *	DTZUZO (~DTZUZO@S0106bcd16584b0aa.vs.shawcable.net) has joined
Aug 30 23:00:49 <arahael>	It's a fairly large AST, it would be amazing if it could be done magically.
Aug 30 23:00:54 <c_wraith>	You would do that by making an Arbitrary instance for your type

Aug 30 23:01:24 *	dandoh (0ee73110@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.231.49.16) has joined
Aug 30 23:01:38 <c_wraith>	Eh, you probably want to have some manual control, or else it will create trees that are so deep that the tests take forever to run
Aug 30 23:02:02 <arahael>	Hmm, good poit.
Aug 30 23:02:26 <c_wraith>	But if you want to see what you can do automatically, there are libraries like https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-arbitrary
Aug 30 23:02:40 <arahael>	I suppose I shouldn't complain, it's already vastly more concise than I would have achieved in any other language.
Aug 30 23:02:43 *	tromp has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Aug 30 23:02:46 *	arahael checks out generic-arbitrary.

Aug 30 23:04:00 <c_wraith>	hopefully it even creates things of reasonable sizes. :)
Aug 30 23:04:17 <arahael>	Heh, I guess I'll find out, once I get to it. :)

Aug 31 02:23:54 <zenspider>	soo... I'm trying to move from globally installed ghc + cabal + pkgs to stack ... and I guess I'm not getting something. I've removed the old global ghc + cabal and I've done stack setup and re-installed a number of packages local to that ghc... but some of the old packages aren't installing via `stack install` (which I understood used cabal under the covers)
Aug 31 02:24:01 <zenspider>	1) Some of the dependencies aren't resolving correctly, so I have to add them to the global stack.yaml in the extra-deps. That seems really odd, and/or broken?
Aug 31 02:24:04 <zenspider>	2) some of the packages didn't actually build. structured-haskell-mode for example now fails out near the very end of the build because `descriptive` fails.
Aug 31 02:24:31 <zenspider>	I'm guessing I just don't get something yet as I'm very new to stack (and still pretty new to haskell outside of a textbook)
Aug 31 02:24:47 <cocreature>	zenspider: are you trying to install Haskell executables, install Haskell libraries globally or install the dependencies of a Haskell project?
Aug 31 02:25:18 *	IstiCusi (~phonon@87.239.207.49) has joined
Aug 31 02:25:24 <zenspider>	I think the answer is haskell executables ... to help with my dev environment (emacs tooling) and such
Aug 31 02:25:52 <zenspider>	I dunno if I bumped up into a version of haskell that is just broken for some of these libraries? or... what.
Aug 31 02:25:57 <zenspider>	(and I don't know HOW to tell)
Aug 31 02:26:07 <cocreature>	okay, in that case "stack install" is at least the right command to use (it is not the right command for installing libraries)
Aug 31 02:26:16 <cocreature>	can you show us the specific errors you are seeing?

Aug 31 02:26:44 <zenspider>	well, with regard to 1:
Aug 31 02:26:52 <zenspider>	In the dependencies for structured-haskell-mode-1.1.0: descriptive must match >=0.7 && <0.10, but the stack configuration has no specified version  (latest matching version is 0.9.4) 
Aug 31 02:27:04 <zenspider>	says to run stack solver (which just sits there... for a REALLY long time?)
Aug 31 02:27:17 <zenspider>	or to manually list the dependency in global stack.yaml
Aug 31 02:27:25 <cocreature>	right, I would go for the latter

Aug 31 02:27:41 <zenspider>	but... cabal installed it fine? what am I not getting?
Aug 31 02:27:44 <cocreature>	so it might make sense to just avoid it all together
Aug 31 02:27:57 <zenspider>	oh poo. that's too bad. I would have loved to have paredit like stuff in haskell-mode
Aug 31 02:28:12 <cocreature>	by default stack takes packages from "stackage", a snapshot of a subset of packages on hackage locked to specific versions that are known to work together

Aug 31 02:29:16 <cocreature>	right, cabal looks at all packages on hackage and their version constraints and tries to come up with a set of versions that are compatible with the constraints
Aug 31 02:29:21 <zenspider>	based on something I read, the first thing I installed via `stack install` was cabal :P

Aug 31 03:57:59 <jkarni>	fendor: well, reproducibility depends a lot more on your setup than on servant-client
Aug 31 03:58:03 <alp>	fendor, if you want to test the logic of your handlers, use servant-client, because it'll produce well-formed requests.
Aug 31 03:58:23 <jkarni>	alp: hi Alp :)
Aug 31 03:58:39 <alp>	if you want to test the overall behaviour of the web app with respect to good practices and what not, servant-quickcheck and hspec-wai are good helpers
Aug 31 03:58:51 <alp>	the former will hit all your endpoints and verify that they meet some user specified properties

Aug 31 05:04:10 <alp>	no, middlewares can see the request come in and the response go out
Aug 31 05:04:21 <alp>	and they can tweak the request on its way to the app or the response on its way to the client
Aug 31 05:04:51 <fendor>	alp, and if i want to log service level stuff?

Aug 31 05:07:57 <alp>	so e.g you can write a middleware that turns <some request body> into { error: <the request body> } and adds the appropriate json content type header, whenever it sees a response being returned with status code 4xx

Aug 31 05:08:54 <alp>	fendor, whatever is more appropriate. I don't really know what you mean by "service level", but if you mean things like "registered a new user with email foo@bar.com", then... well, it depends on what you want to do with those logs

Aug 31 05:11:04 <alp>	nothing prevents you from having a middleware that logs HTTP-level stuffs and another logging mechanism, sending the logs somewhere else, that lets you record all the things the handlers are doing

Aug 31 05:16:26 <dmwit>	Sure. `Either` is sort of `Either`. Or you can make a custom combiner as suggested by cocreature.
Aug 31 05:16:29 <rkrishnan>	cocreature: like an library wide error sum type? That is what I have now. I was wondering is that is a good approach or if it is a better approach to have a module specific error sum type because then the error type resides in the module than in another place.

Aug 31 05:56:48 <[exa]>	ArahaelPi: but there's a 'safe bet': install GHC in wine and use it to produce windows executables
Aug 31 05:57:01 <byorgey>	Viwor: if I were you I would ask the maintainer of hsdev about it
Aug 31 05:57:05 <[exa]>	ArahaelPi: afaik it won't be even complicated,  you just do 'wine cabal build'
Aug 31 05:57:17 <Ariakenom>	I know there has been recent work on cross compilation. But I don't know more.
Aug 31 05:57:17 <ArahaelPi>	zincy: megaparsec, I think, will evaluate "many anychar" first, until it can't parse any more, and check for a 'char ,'

Aug 31 06:13:25 <ArahaelPi>	Honestly I'd been on-and-off learning haskell for a while, but lets-lens and this parser activity really got me set to using haskell.
Aug 31 06:13:44 <ArahaelPi>	Incidentially, do people seriously use haskell to target other langauges?
Aug 31 06:14:07 <cocreature>	oh I totally misread the name. I somehow thought this was about lenses for let-expressions and I have no what that should be :)
Aug 31 06:14:21 <ArahaelPi>	Ah, no worries :)

Aug 31 08:51:00 <lambdabot>	Applicative m => Int -> m a -> m [a]
Aug 31 08:51:45 <dmwit>	zincy: First we define bound variables.
Aug 31 08:52:13 <dmwit>	zincy: Bound variables are variables which are created by an enclosing `let` or lambda, or by a following `where`.
Aug 31 08:52:26 <dmwit>	zincy: Free variables are variables which aren't bound.
Aug 31 08:52:34 <zincy>	So a bound variable is a named variable?
Aug 31 08:52:45 <dmwit>	zincy: For example, in `\x -> x + 3`, (+) is free.
Aug 31 08:53:32 <dmwit>	zincy: Similarly, in `\n act -> sequence (replicate n act)` (the definition of `replicateM`), `n` and `act` are bound but `sequence` and `replicate` are free.

Aug 31 12:02:26 <tdammers>	_sfiguser: the crucial thing to understand is how evaluation and execution are completely separate concerns in Haskell - the language itself only covers evaluation, execution happens in the runtime
Aug 31 12:02:57 <maerwald>	tdammers: and it's not very well defined, is it?
Aug 31 12:03:33 <tdammers>	_sfiguser: but Haskell closures happen in the realm of the language, not the runtime - so when you close over a variable, the closure inherits the variable's value, but that has no influence on the execution side of things
Aug 31 12:03:37 <maerwald>	so what you gain in terms of reasoning because of "purity" you lose because you have no idea what the runtime does

Aug 31 12:04:29 <tdammers>	maerwald: what you gain is that you can reason (almost) equationally about one fairly well-guarded side of things, as opposed to most other languages, where the two concerns are completely intertwined

Aug 31 12:05:23 <tdammers>	maerwald: you still can't reason very well about the execution part; but fortunately, a lot can be done purely in the evaluation part, and that part is pure (ignoring bottoms and unsafePerformWhatevers)

Aug 31 12:21:54 <dstolfa>	there's very little formal verification in practice

Aug 31 12:57:54 <fenedor>	sent1nel_, why is that not a good idea? for example, what if you need to know about any change in the correct order?
Aug 31 12:57:58 <maerwald>	fenedor: check https://tech-blog.capital-match.com/posts/3-anatomy-of-haskell-web-app.html but it's not too much about the business use case of the decision
Aug 31 12:57:59 *	adad has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Aug 31 12:58:01 <fenedor>	maerwald, may I ask why?
Aug 31 12:58:21 <maerwald>	well, if someone sues you, you gotta be prepared no?
Aug 31 12:58:44 <maerwald>	and it may actually boil down to your proving that there has been no error in your system
Aug 31 12:58:52 <shapr>	wat?
Aug 31 12:59:10 <sent1nel_>	fenedor: imagine a document with hundreds of thousands of changes. essentially you are maintaining a perfect record of hundreds of thousands of events, probably with snapshots. usually, you don't need that record; nobody ctrl+zs back to the first character of document, typically, from a publishable state.
Aug 31 12:59:18 <maerwald>	because you are not saving state
Aug 31 12:59:59 <maerwald>	event sourcing is horribly slow for startup though, unless you have a snapshotting system, which an be quite tricky
Aug 31 13:00:10 <fenedor>	maerwald, you mean, if I have to prove for example that a user read a file at a specific time, event sourcing might make sense? Is event sourcing fitted for audit trails, or should that be handled by something else?
Aug 31 13:00:34 <fenedor>	maerwald, i think, `eventful` or something like that has a snapshotting feature already
Aug 31 13:00:40 <maerwald>	well, that... and that your core business logic can be totally pure!
Aug 31 13:00:46 <sent1nel_>	snapshotting isn't that tricky, but it can be. another problem: without snapshots or a search index, good luck looking up an aggregate by any field by anything other than id, such as an e-mail address for user aggregates

Aug 31 13:02:20 <sent1nel_>	you'd have to have a bulletproof use case for me to recommend using event sourcing in that context

Aug 31 13:02:48 <maerwald>	I cannot say for sure, but wrt financial business logic, event sourcing may also be the natural choice, as in: it's actually easier compared to just storing state
Aug 31 13:02:53 *	boredguy has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
Aug 31 13:03:16 <fenedor>	sent1nel_, in pharma industries, changes made to a data file have be versioned and saved, you have to prove with which version of a file the results have been obtained with.

Aug 31 13:13:47 <fenedor>	what would you say are disadvantages, except if it is just not the use case
Aug 31 13:13:54 <maerwald>	basically you are maintaining a large set of pure event/command/model code, which... in the end really does almost nothing, in terms of actual business logic implementation. Then you create services (see the blog post) which is the only part where you can do something useful

Although i have to eventually mutate a real filesystem, saving the history in a pure manner sounds like a nice architecture to me.

Aug 31 13:29:27 <maerwald>	also, one nice advantage of event sourcing is the single source of truth concept... you can have multiple independent "views" on your data, just by having other "clients" read the events, transform and present them however they want (and possibly cache the state and do a pub-sub thing)
Aug 31 13:29:58 <maerwald>	but there is no doubt that the source of absolute truth is always your event store

Aug 31 16:09:15 <infinisil>	What's you people's favorite way to handle exceptions/errors in haskell?
Aug 31 16:09:35 <monochrom>	Depends on particulars.
Aug 31 16:09:40 <infinisil>	My mind tells me that I want to have a guarantee that the program doesn't crash, and that everything should be well typed
Aug 31 16:10:02 <infinisil>	So these IO exceptions don't sound very nice, and neither does MonadFail 
Aug 31 16:10:07 <monochrom>	So how about this. My favourite way is to actually study the actual problem and make a wise choice.

Aug 31 16:11:06 <infinisil>	Hmm.. Well let's assume it's a complicated application with multiple layers that each can throw errors, you write all the code yourself, no external code used, so you get to choose the error mechanism of every part
Aug 31 16:11:10 <fresheyeball>	hey out there

Aug 31 16:11:20 <fresheyeball>	I am taking in stdin as a conduit
Aug 31 16:11:24 <[exa]>	cross_: sorry, I was afk
Aug 31 16:11:35 <fresheyeball>	and its going to be accepting a comma seperated list as stdin
Aug 31 16:11:45 <geekosaur>	except you don't, because the standard library does stupid things like exposingh synchronous file-open errors as async exceptions
Aug 31 16:11:49 <[exa]>	(oh, wrong highlight)
Aug 31 16:12:10 <infinisil>	geekosaur: Heh right, okay let's say you can wrap everything in your favorite way to handle errors
Aug 31 16:12:34 <fresheyeball>	any recommendation on how to split by `Producer IO ByteString` on ',' such that the new conduit has one per item?
Aug 31 16:12:43 <fresheyeball>	"foo,bar" -> ["foo","bar"]
Aug 31 16:12:46 <fresheyeball>	but with conduits
Aug 31 16:13:20 <infinisil>	That makes me think.. Isn't there some way to make libraries output the "most general error type", such that it can be converted to anything the user desires? Via some typeclass of course
Aug 31 16:13:21 *	iAmerika1 has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
Aug 31 16:13:32 <monochrom>	I stick to the standard IOExceptions for IO things. For non-IO things, they already use Maybe or Either already.

Aug 31 16:14:14 <fresheyeball>	Also sourceHandle stdin :: Producer IO ByteString confuses me
Aug 31 16:14:22 <fresheyeball>	because ByteString is already a stream
Aug 31 16:14:45 <fresheyeball>	so it this? what the equlivlant of [ByteString] or ByteString?

Aug 31 16:15:46 <monochrom>	Yeah why are you afraid of "it depends"?
Aug 31 16:18:43 <threewood>	And different still are assertion failures where we know something went wrong, but often not exactly what went wrong
